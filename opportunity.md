![openning](vanderbilt_ad.jpg) 


## Open postdoc positions
* We are actively looking for one postdoc or computer engineering/science technician to work on **multimodal wireless bioelectronics**. 

Strong candidates should send 1) Cover Letter, 2) resume/CV, and 3) representative papers in a single PDF to Dr. Yayun Du via email yayun.du@vanderbilt.edu. 

## Open PhD positions
* We welcome exceptional Ph.D. candidates with a passion for pioneering advancements in bioelectronics, medical robotics, and human-robot/computer interaction. If you're eager to make a transformative impact in these fields, we encourage you to apply.

We are currently seeking:

* 1-2 Ph.D. students in bioelectronics: We are particularly interested in candidates with skills in embedded system programming, circuit design, signal processing, or embedded AI, but we welcome anyone with a strong interest and background in bioelectronics.
* 1 Ph.D. student in robotics and control: Ideal candidates will have experience in robotic design, control systems, sensor fusion, SLAM, or learning techniques, with a preference for those familiar with ROS and medical or human-robot interaction applications.
We encourage applications from students who are excited about working in interdisciplinary fields and are motivated to develop innovative solutions for challenging environments, including medical applications.

Please **submit your application to the Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD program** at Vanderbilt by **December 15th, 2024**, for Fall 2025 admissions. For detailed instructions, visit the [ECE Graduate Admissions page](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/departments/electrical-computer-engineering/graduate-programs/). After submitting your program application, please fill out this [**Application Form, Graduate**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2R8mHHPZ7_6N7D8787DcqJr44bk4RXI-nqb5jpJEmQChdRg/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0) and a single PDF containing your Cover Letter, resume/CV, and representative papers (if any) to Dr. Yayun Du via email yayun.du[at]vanderbilt.edu. 

## Master and undergraduate students
* Dr. Du's mentees have a strong track record of success, with many gaining admission to top graduate programs, including MIT, Stanford, Cornell, CMU, UCLA, University of Michigan, UIUC, and Dartmouth, or securing influential positions in industry with companies like JPL, Google, Amazon Robotics, TuSimple, and General Motors. We invite motivated Master's and undergraduate students to join our research projects in bioelectronics and digital health, with applications in both hospital and home settings. Our work also delves into medical robotics for critical environments like intensive care units (ICUs) and multimodal physiology-driven human-robot/computer interaction for safe and efficient collaboration. If you're passionate about advancing these fields, we encourage you to apply.

Interested students should fill out this [**Application Form, UG**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2R8mHHPZ7_6N7D8787DcqJr44bk4RXI-nqb5jpJEmQChdRg/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0), and send 1) Cover Letter, 2) resume/CV, 3) unofficial transcript in a single PDF to Dr. Yayun Du via email yayun.du[at]vanderbilt.edu. 


## Visiting students and researchers
* We welcome inquiries from visiting students and researchers interested in short-term and long-term visits and collaborative opportunities. 

Please send your Cover Letter, resume/CV and representative papers (if any) in a single PDF to Dr. Yayun Du via email yayun.du[at]vanderbilt.edu. I will try to reach you back as soon as possible.
