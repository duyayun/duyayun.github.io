- **Kâ€“12 STEM Outreach**: Demonstrations and workshops introducing biomedical engineering and wearable technologies to younger students.
- **Community Engagement**: Collaboration with local schools and nonprofit organizations to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.
- **Diversity and Inclusion**: Proactively supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds through inclusive mentorship and training opportunities.
